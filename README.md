# RIETAN-2000 Rev. 1.2 for UNIX/FreeBSD/Linux
This RIETAN-2000 package simply contains RIETAN-2000 and ORFFE. Currently, I regard these programs for UNIX/FreeBSD/Linux as stand-alone programs launched with telnet from Mac OS and Windows machines.
While pressing the shift key, click the mouse button (don't continue to press it) on the following archive file name

rietan2000u.tbz (2003/06/04; 408 KB)
Move the downloaded file to a directory where you want to install the RIETAN-2000 package. Unless you can download it, try to click on the above file name while pressing the shift key. In the directory, execute the following commands to create a directory called rietan2k:
bzip2 -d rietan2000u.tbz
tar xvf rietan2000u.tar

Read a text file, readme_unix, under directory rietan2k carefully to get further information.

You can use gnuplot script files, *.plt, included in the distribution files for Mac OS and Windows with 'set terminal x11'.
# License agreement
I somewhat hesitate to make my dirty source code open. It is, however, indispensable for debugging the program, learning techniques of crystallographic computing, and implementing new features in RIETAN-2000. I have benefitted from a number of free software packages. I am, hence, willing to deliver RIETAN-2000 as open-source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) plus additional conditions described in what follows.
Whenever original results acquired with RIETAN-2000 are published in journals, proceedings, facility reports, etc. or reported in scientific meetings with abstracts, the program name "RIETAN-2000" (or shortly "RIETAN") should explicitly be stated. Furthermore, cite the following paper:

F. Izumi and T. Ikeda, Mater. Sci. Forum, 321-324 (2000) 198-203.
Note that "321-324" is volume numbers while "198-203" is a range of pages. Only giving credit to RIETAN-2000 for Rietveld or Le Bail analysis is fine in the cases of abstracts, short reports, and so forth with limited spaces, e.g., as follows:
Structure parameters of CaTiO3 were refined by the Rietveld method from the X-ray diffraction data with RIETAN-2000.

So long as all the above conditions are satisfied, RIETAN-2000 is 'copylefted' with its source code freely available to everyone in the world. Anyone is free to copy, modify, redistribute, and sell it under the terms of the GPL. Providing pay services to users of RIETAN-2000 is welcome.

Although RIETAN-2000 has exhaustively been tested with intensity data of many compounds, it may still contain a fair number of bugs. RIETAN-2000 is distributed in the hope that it will be useful and reliable. It is, however, provided "as is'' without any warranty since I have a number of commitments on my time. There is no charge for the program, per se, whereas technical service concerning it is not free.
